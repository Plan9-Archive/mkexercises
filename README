This is a collection of exercises to interactively learn the mk build automation tool.
Each example has:
 * a mkfile with comments that needs editing to work correctly
 * some example starting files
 * a solution file named mksolution to compare your solution with

I highly recommend reading the following before using these exercises.
I will be basing my exercises on them.
 * the mk man page
 * /sys/doc/mk.ps
 * /sys/doc/mkfiles.ps
Read them even if you won't fully understand them!
It will slowly make sense as your brain processes it.

mk also requires significant knowledge of rc and various utilities.
Be sure to look up the man pages of any utilities you don't recognize.
